# CS290 Final

Run server.py and go to http://localhost:8000/documentation.html

The password is password for the private pages

I would like server.py to count towards assignment 5 credit.

## Webpages

#### [Linn Benton Homepage:](https://www.linnbenton.edu/)

I just hate it even more after taking this course. I really don't like how slow every single page is to load, especially when logging in to single sign on. I am not sure what it is causing the issue, if it is the visuals, the backend code, the bandwidth, or something else. The colors also just clash to me, I wish there was a native dark mode. The dropdown menus are clunky and botton animations are annoying.

#### [Gmail:](https://mail.google.com/)

Reevalutating GMail made me appreciate just how customizable it is. There is a wealth of options in the settings menu that I just don't use. The layout is simple but also provides all the information and options you need. If there is something about the layout you don't like, you can probably change it.

#### [Spotify:](https://open.spotify.com/)

My opinion on spotify changed a little bit since the beginning of the term. I don't like the folder system for sorting playlist and alboms since it doesn't actually put them in folders, but copies them and just displays them. The homepage is also rather cluttered. I would change the interface to be simpler and with less animations and visuals. It all just slows the website down and makes it more clunky.

#### [5e tools:](https://5e.tools/index.html)

Doing this course made me appreciate just how intuitive and easy to use 5etools is. The website is simple html with no flashy visuals since that is all it needs to be as a reference materials website. What I didn't notice before is that you can even save the state of the website to your local machine and if you want to share it with someone else you can load it from the file. All of the dropdowns and buttons are very visible and easily identified. The website is also very fast to load since it is mostly simple html with few visuals and scripting.

#### [Github:](https://github.com/)

My analysis of Github stayed mostly the same, the design and layout of the website is good. I wouldn't personally change much.

## My Projects

#### Assignment 1

This was of course just bare bones html, but it got the information it needed to across and was organized well.

#### Assignment 2

The start page of this assingment was really ugly, but I would say the portfolio page was a step up from the Assignment 1 page. A new understanding of css allowed some background changes and header styling.

#### Assignment 3

This was my first foray into serious thought on how I wanted to desing a webpage. I chose a good color scheme for the background and started putting elements such as dropdowns and site maps on the page. For a simple website, it looked okay.

#### Assignment 4

This assingment wasn't meant to look good, but to just show off how scripting could work. The design got across exactly what it needed to. It didn't look bad, but it didn't have any special styling.
